# Python Excel Data Generator

I decided to create a small program to help me generate random Excel data, to practice
built-in functions.  
But it soon became a larger project worthy for Github!

## How to use

1. Specify a row to stop at
2. The end!

Note that it saves the data in a `.csv` file, and you'll have to save it as a
`.xlsx` in order to use Excel functions in it!
